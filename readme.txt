DEMO (original): https://gabrielerapino.com/episim-en.html


This tool has the goal of simulating, in a super-simplified fashion and at qualitative level only, the effect of an epidemic outbreak on a population, and how social distancing measures can mitigate its impact. I developed during the Covid-19 pandemic is devastating the world and Italy (my country) in particular.

This idea sparked in my mind after I read these amazing articles written by Tomas Pueyo.

For the implementation, I took inspiration from these fantastic tools: this by Harry Stevens on the Washington Post, this by Kevin Simler and this by Gabriel Goh.

Disclaimer:

I'm not an epidemiologist, nor a doctor. Since the devastating Covid-19 outbreak in Italy, I started to study the problem and the SIR model in particular, from which I took ideas for the simulation; this tool is not suitable by any means to describe accurately the Covid-19 outbreak and has not been validated by any expert. If you are an epidemiologist and you want to give me some advice for improvement, please write me.
